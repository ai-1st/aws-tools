# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides AWS API integration tools for use in Vercel AI SDK as an npm module. The tools are designed to handle AWS API responses that may contain thousands of datapoints by providing both human-readable summaries for LLM context and structured JSON data for charting. The module includes tools for EC2 instances, cost analysis, CloudWatch metrics, and cost optimization recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Vercel AI SDK, I want to access AWS EC2 instance information, so that I can analyze and monitor my infrastructure within AI applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls awsDescribeInstances THEN the system SHALL return detailed EC2 instance information including configuration, state, and pricing
2. WHEN the tool is invoked with a region parameter THEN the system SHALL query EC2 instances in that specific region
3. WHEN AWS credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message with guidance
4. WHEN the user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating required IAM permissions (ec2:DescribeInstances)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve AWS cost and usage data, so that I can analyze spending patterns and optimize costs in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls awsGetCostAndUsage with DAILY granularity THEN the system SHALL return cost data for the specified number of days ending yesterday
2. WHEN a user calls awsGetCostAndUsage with MONTHLY granularity THEN the system SHALL return cost data for the specified number of full months ending with the previous month
3. WHEN no lookBack parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL use default values (30 for DAILY, 6 for MONTHLY)
4. WHEN groupBy parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL group results by the specified dimensions with a maximum of 2 grouping dimensions
5. WHEN filter parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL apply Cost Explorer filters to the query

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access CloudWatch metrics, so that I can monitor AWS service performance and create visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls awsCloudWatchGetMetrics THEN the system SHALL retrieve CloudWatch metrics for any AWS service
2. WHEN flexible dimensions are provided THEN the system SHALL query metrics with those specific dimensions
3. WHEN time periods are specified THEN the system SHALL return metrics for the requested time range
4. WHEN the user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating required IAM permissions (cloudwatch:GetMetricData)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get cost optimization recommendations, so that I can identify opportunities to reduce AWS spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls awsCostOptimizationHubListRecommendations THEN the system SHALL retrieve cost optimization recommendations from AWS Cost Optimization Hub
2. WHEN the user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating required IAM permissions (ce:GetRecommendations)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data formats from all AWS tools, so that I can reliably process responses in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AWS tool returns data THEN the system SHALL provide both a summary field with human-readable text and a datapoints field with structured JSON
2. WHEN the summary is generated THEN the system SHALL use heuristics tailored for each tool to prevent LLM context overflow
3. WHEN datapoints are returned THEN the system SHALL provide exact data points suitable for charting and analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively when using AWS tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture and return descriptive error messages
2. WHEN input parameter validation fails THEN the system SHALL clearly report validation errors
3. WHEN network errors or timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on credential setup
5. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL handle AWS API throttling with retries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible AWS credential configuration, so that I can authenticate using various methods based on my deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are provided directly in configuration THEN the system SHALL use those credentials for AWS API calls
2. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the system SHALL use AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
3. WHEN AWS credentials file exists THEN the system SHALL use credentials from ~/.aws/credentials
4. WHEN running on EC2 or ECS THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles for authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined tool schemas, so that I can understand input parameters and expected outputs for integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing tool metadata THEN the system SHALL provide name, description, inputSchema, and outputSchema for each tool
2. WHEN configSchema is applicable THEN the system SHALL provide JSON schema for configuration parameters
3. WHEN defaultConfig exists THEN the system SHALL provide default configuration values
4. WHEN invoking tools THEN the system SHALL validate inputs against the defined schemas

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the AWS tools functionality, so that I can ensure reliability in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm test THEN the system SHALL execute all test suites
2. WHEN running npm run test:verbose THEN the system SHALL provide detailed test output
3. WHEN running npm run test:file with a specific test THEN the system SHALL execute only that test file
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate tool functionality, error handling, and data formats
